# Simple Counters
There should be no "hard coding" in this set. These can be done with for loops, while loops or recursion.

## Problem 1
Ask the console for an input. Then print all numbers from 1 -> that number in increments of 1 up to that number. The code should work for any number up to 2<sup>8</sup>-1.

### Input of 1
```
1
```

### Input of 5
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

### Input of 16
```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
```

## Problem 2

Ask the console for an input. Then print all numbers from that number -> 1 in increments of 1. The code should work for any number up to 2<sup>8</sup>-1.

### Input of 1
```
1
```

### Input of 5
```
5
4
3
2
1
```
## Problem 3

Ask the console for an input. Then print all numbers from that 0 -> that number in increments of 5. The code should work for any number up to 2<sup>8</sup>-1.

### Input of 5
```
0
```

### Input of 6
```
0
5
```

### Input of 20
```
0
