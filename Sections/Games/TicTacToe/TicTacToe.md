## Project 
- [ ] Have a system where you can play tic-tac-toe against a person (2 player tic tac toe)
- [ ] The program ends when one player wins or the game ends in a tie

## For Teachers

The goal of this is to build off of Rock Paper Scissors but add harder logic/more conditions.

## Submissions
- I'm starting to only allow submissions via github. We're going to start slowly learning what that is but for now, just the GUI should suffice

## Future Ideas 
- [ ] Make it play against a computer instead of a human
  - [ ] Make the computer "static"
  - [ ] Make the computer "always tie"
- [ ] Add a GUI
