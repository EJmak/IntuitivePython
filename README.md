# PythonicThinking
This is the repo dedicated to my teaching efforts with a 4th --> 5th grader. We'll see where it goes :)

## Assumptions from this point
- Can get a program running
- is familiar with their shell env
- has basic understandings of for/while etc.
- We're using a python for kids book and are at "classes and definitions for now"
