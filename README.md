# PythonicThinking
This is the repo dedicated to my creating a curriculum for a 4th --> 5th grader. We'll see where it goes :)

## Assumptions from this point
- Can get a program running
- is familiar with their shell env
- has basic understandings of for/while etc.
- We're using a python for [kids book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Kids-Playful-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593274076/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2PIBSMVYES5Q9&keywords=python+for+kids&qid=1666965299&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi42NiIsInFzcCI6IjIuNjIifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=python+for+kid%2Caps%2C130&sr=8-1) and are at "classes and definitions for now" 


## Some things I'm trying to enforce
- All work on this comes AFTER schoolwork/house chores etc.
- Trying my best to do the problems as I can in C/C++/C# to have an answer key of sorts
- Slowly integrating tools/concepts one at a time
- Learn then do. Don't move on until "Do" is done.
