# IntuitivePython

This is the repo dedicated to my creating a curriculum for a 4th --> 5th grader. We'll see where it goes :)

## Assumptions from this point
- Can get a program running
- We're using a python for [kids book](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Kids-Playful-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593274076/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2PIBSMVYES5Q9&keywords=python+for+kids&qid=1666965299&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjQ3IiwicXNhIjoiMi42NiIsInFzcCI6IjIuNjIifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=python+for+kid%2Caps%2C130&sr=8-1) and are at "classes and definitions for now" 
- For [adults](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Crash-Course-2nd-Edition/dp/1593279280/ref=sr_1_1?crid=106XAKPYOLQAI&keywords=python+crash+course&qid=1669564800&sprefix=python+crash+cou%2Caps%2C208&sr=8-1) 
- [This is known](https://github.com/rakirs2/general-notes/blob/main/ShellBasics.md)

## Some things I'm trying to enforce
- All work on this comes AFTER schoolwork/house chores etc.
- Trying my best to do the problems as I can in C/C++/C# to have an answer key of sorts
- Slowly integrating tools/concepts one at a time
- Learn then do. Don't move on until "Do" is done.


## Things that are working
- spending time/having fun
- showing things that work and having the student recreate them
- giving answer keys?

## Things that need reconsideration
- Remember the student's age. Just because you (Srikar) learned in College as a first language doesn't meant that everyone should learn that way
- I would consider doing a few of these in C for an older/more mature student. I really love CS50's C --> Python but I think for younger students, some validation beyond hello world is really, really awesome and gets them to code more.
- I need a better way to handle errors so I want to abuse github so the student has to paste here and I can actually see what they're doing rather than screen shots
- I want a "database" of potential errors and how to recreate/fix them
- Creating code is easy, reusing code is hard. I need a way to force understanding that
