# Computer Setup

Fundamentally, we want to get used to using the command line as much as possible

For this, so far, all we need is python3, pip, vscode, and git. 

## Operating Systems

### Linux
This is what you've been using. The manager that I used is something that gets installed default with linux (apt-get)

so if you remember
```bash
apt-get install code
```

I did this for everything we needed step by step. So all 4 of the programs listed above (some come as part of the operating system.

### Windows
There are a few package managers on windows. Namely chocolatey, winget etc. We are going to stick with Winget as it's the default implementation.

Windows has 3 different terminals.
- Command Prompt (the oldest)
- Powershell
- "new cross platform powershell 7. something"

They are all usable but we want to use the latest version of Powershell

[Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.3#winget)

### Mac

Fundamentally install homebrew and then use homebrew to install the programs we want

### Next Steps

After this, make sure you're able to access all of your files. make sure you're able to run a hello world code snippet in python both inside of code and in your terminal
Finally, make sure you can clone this repo with git and then create a Pull Request
