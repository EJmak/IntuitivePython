# Homework

## Covered
- vertical line graphing
- horizontal line graphing
- longer term goal
- cartesian coordinates
- some basic systems of equations
- Bohr model of the atom

## Preliminary
- How are you going to "invest" in here. What are you going to give up?

## Coding/Reading
- Chapter 2 of Python crash course. Submit all problems (I think there are 12) as separate files via github

## Math
1. graph the following on paper:
    - x = 2
    - y =3
    - x = -5
    - y = 10
2. Solve the following algebraicly and graphically. All graphs must have 2 points and if lines intersect, the intersecction point. So if 2 lines intersect, 2 points + intesection point unless interseciton point is an intercept
    - 3x+4 = y; 6x-2 = y
    - 2x + 2 = y; -3x +2 = y
    - 4x - 6 = y; -2x+3 =y
    - 4x - 6 = y; -2x + 4 = y
