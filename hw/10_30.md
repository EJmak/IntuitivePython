1. Reading/understand the chapter
2. Do two problems at the end of the book
3. Create a class called deck of cards with three functions:
- shuffle (prints "shuffling cards")
- draw (prints "drawing cards")
- add cards (prints "adding cards")
4. create an object of class deck and have show that you can access all three methods
5. Think about a 'card' object
- what are the qualities you'd want for a card object?
