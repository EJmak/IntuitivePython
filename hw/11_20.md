# Review

- went over challenge problem 3
- talked about expectations for this week
- learned the 'hw button exists'

## Homework
## HW - Miscellaneous
1. Clean up your file system on your computer. I can't find it, I deleted it, etc. are no longer valid excuses. 
2. From here on out, please try to keep a separate folder for this weeks homework (i'd suggest doing it by chapter in the book)
3. Make an account with your email on [github](https://github.com)

## HW - Book Problems (must do)
1. Chapter 8 both problems in the back of the book
2. Solve the rest of the "challenge problems" with for and while loops. I believe there is problem 3. There are a lot of ways to do the 3rd problem
3. Rock Paper Scissors
* Try just creating logic for RPS, if you have time, create scoring system
