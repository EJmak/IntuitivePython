## Misc
So all new homework will be listed here.

## HW - Miscellaneous
1. Clean up your file system on your computer. I can't find it, I deleted it, etc. are no longer valid excuses. 
2. From here on out, please try to keep a separate folder for this weeks homework (i'd suggest doing it by chapter in the book)
3. Make an account with your email on [projectEuler.org](https://projecteuler.net/)

## HW - Book Problems (must do)

2. Solve the rest of the "challenge problems" with for and while loops. I believe there is problem 3. There are a lot of ways to do the 3rd problem
3. Using the nfl teams, create a program that can list out the teams starter code that I put in your computer (you can just reuse that file if you'd like
