# Homework
This week the hw goals are pretty simple. 
1. Work on the problems you find in Tic Tac Toe .py
2. Clean up your submissions in the submissions folder
3. Play with [Chat GPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) 

I'll add the helpers in this week for how to deal with mappings and some potential ways to handle user input
